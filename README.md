# mern-miniproject
This project is contains signUp, login, cart functionality, product in store and filter functionality with smooth running, single page web application with responsive design by using MERN technology. I hope you wil love this application .
I used html, css, javascript and famous javascript library i.e. ReactJS for frontend and for backend I used NodeJS, ExpressJS for easy connection and Mongo Atlas as Database.
Whatever I had studied regarding to become full stack or mern stack I used everything and gained some handsOn experience.
